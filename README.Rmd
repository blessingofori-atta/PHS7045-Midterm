The goal of symbootpkg is to provide flexible tools to compute bootstrap-t, equal-tailed, and symmetric confidence intervals for statistical analysis. It incorporates methods for plugin and nested bootstrap standard error estimations, with options for parallelization to improve efficiency.

## Features
- **Bootstrap-t Confidence Intervals**: Compute confidence intervals using the bootstrap-t method with options for plugin and nested standard error estimates.
- **Equal-Tailed and Symmetric Intervals**: Includes methods for both equal-tailed and symmetric bootstrap confidence intervals.
- **Flexible Standard Error Functions**: Supports user-specified `sdfun` functions or nested bootstrap for standard error estimation.
- **Parallel Processing**: Optional parallelization to leverage multiple cores for faster computation.


## Installation

You can install the development version of symbootpkg like so:

``` r
# FILL THIS IN! HOW CAN PEOPLE INSTALL YOUR DEV PACKAGE?
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(symbootpkg)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
